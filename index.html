 <p><font face="Raleway, sans serif"> *
Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.</font></p>

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif"> * Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.</font></p>

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif"> * Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.</font></p>

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif"> * Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif"> * Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities</font></p>

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through paragraph 31 calls for the widest possible international cooperation aimed at accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions and addressing adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change.</font></p> 
<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">Both paragraph 31 of Agenda 2030 and paragraph 91 of the Future We Want note the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with having a likely chance of holding the increase in global average temperature below 2 °C or 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.</font></p>


<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">Air pollution was seen as having serious adverse impacts on the quality of life, in particular on human health, the environment and the economy. Therefore an integrated approach to tackle both indoor and outdoor air pollution that took into account the related environmental, economic and social consequences was needed. Mitigation efforts should be better integrated into national development planning processes.Industry and various forms of transportation might contribute significantly to air pollution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">The General Assembly,Requests the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa and appropriate bodies of the Convention, within the scope of the Convention, to improve the effectiveness of collaboration with the secretariats of the other Rio conventions and other partners at the national.</font></p>


<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">
    Education in developing countries is an incredibly important tool that needs to be utilized in order to help people understand the best way to use the land that they are farming on.

    Technology Advances. In some cases, it’s difficult to try and prevent desertification from happening. In those cases, there needs to be research and advancements in technology that push the limits of what we currently know. Advancements could help us find more ways to prevent the issue from becoming epidemic.

    Putting Together Rehabilitation Efforts. There are some ways that we can go back and rehabilitate the land that we’ve already pushed into desertification; it just takes some investment of time and money. By putting these together, we can prevent the issue from becoming even more widespread in the areas that have already been affected.</font></p>

<h3><strong><font face="Rleway, sans serif"><font color="purple">Biodiversity and ecosystems</font></font></strong></h3>

<p><img src="http://www.web.mvm.ed.ac.uk/images/zoofrontpage3.jpg" alt="Biodiversity and ecosystems" title="" /></p>

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">Climate change is already having an impact on biodiversity, and is projected to become a progressively more significant threat in the coming decades. Loss of Arctic sea ice threatens biodiversity across an entire biome and beyond. The related pressure of ocean acidification, resulting from higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is also already being observed.

Ecosystems are already showing negative impacts under current levels of climate change … which is modest compared to future projected changes…. In addition to warming temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events and changing patterns of rainfall and drought can be expected to have significant impacts on biodiversity.</font></p>


 <p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">These ecosystemprocesses are controlled by both the diversity and identity of the plant, animal, and microbial species living within a community.Human modifications to the living community in an ecosystem as well as to the collective biodiversity of the earth can therefore alter ecological functions and life support services that are vital to the well-being of human societies.

<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">With the stakes this high and the outlook this unclear, businesses must begin making better clean-tech investments immediately. Looking at the slate of possible solutions, inventors and investors alike need to understand more quickly how much carbon emissions can really be abated and which innovations will be most effective at addressing the problem in the least amount of time.</font></p>

<h3><em><font face="Raleway, sans serif">Summary:</font></em></h3>
<p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves".</font></p><p><font face="Raleway, sans serif">Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.</font></p>
